Short term:

  - get rid of positional arguments and add configuration file (with
    versioning?)

  - Make it multi-mode??

  - ability to upload/replace images

Longer term:

  - Syntax highlighting for ghci sessions.  Will probably require some
    refactoring.

  - diagrams -- at first, just have it separate.  Maybe later make a
    plugin system for BlogLiterately that can ship out specially marked
    blocks to external tools?

  - Improve ghci interaction so it returns error messages, etc.

  - allow specifying whether display-style LaTeX should be centered
    when using --wplatex.

  - allow output using MathJax.
