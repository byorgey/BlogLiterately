This is a test.

> x :: Int
> x = 3

Some more testing. `\pi = \tau/2`:math:.

::

    foo
    bar

~~~~ { .haskell }
-- Foo
foo :: String
~~~~

And with ghci:

::

    [ghci]
    (x + 2 :: Int)
    [1..8]

How about that!  Here's some more ghci:

::

    [ghci]
    [1..100]

Inline `\LaTeX`:math:: `\sum_{i=1}^n i^2`:math: vs. display-style:

Here's an image:

.. image:: images/puppy.jpg
   :alt: A dog.

I wonder why deleting a line only goes to the second column.

::

    [python]
    for x in a:
        print x, len(x)
