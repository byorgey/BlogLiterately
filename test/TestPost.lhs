This is a test.

> x :: Int
> x = 3

Some more testing. $\pi = \tau/2$.

    foo
    bar

And with ghci:

    [ghci]
    (x + 2 :: Int)
    [1..8]

How about that!  Here's some more ghci:

    [ghci]
    [1..100]

Inline $\LaTeX$: $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$ vs. display-style:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$$

Neato!  And also $latex \pi$.

Here's an image:

I wonder why deleting a line only goes to the second column.
